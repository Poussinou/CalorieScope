# CalorieScope
CalorieScope is an android app for tracking your body fitness.

Note: This snapshot of repository contains Diet Manager module and respective assets which were developed by Sourav Kainth. This snapshot of repository also contains remiders module which was more or less incompletely implemented by Sourav Kainth (not his fault :D ) since it was actually ported from a legacy android application known as Remindly. Both of these modules are not present in master branch since they won't be maintained anymore.
